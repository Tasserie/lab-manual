  Over the years, some of the methodological concepts we developed have gotten
  standardized namings. It would be optimal, to talk and write about them using
  the same nomenclature.

# Nomenclature

**Standardized terms are formatted in `code format`**

* **`DBS Network Mapping`**
  * Brief description:
    * Seeding from `DBS stimulation volumes` using either functional or structural, either normative or patient-specific connectomes, we derive a&#x20;
      * `Connectivity Fingerprint`
        * Synonym: `Connectivity Profile`
    * Across a group of patients, the Connectivity Fingerprints are correlated in voxel-wise fashion to derive an `R-map model`
  * Synonym: Connectivity Benefit Mapping
  * [Primer here](https://www.lead-dbs.org/helpsupport/knowledge-base/lead-dbs-methods/connectivity-benefit-mapping/)
  * Key papers:
    * Horn et al. 2017 AoN (first introduced)
    * Al-Fatly et al. 2019 Brain
* **`DBS Fiber Filtering`**
  * Synonym: Discriminative Fibertract Analysis
  * Synonym: Discriminative Fiber Tractography
  * Key papers:&#x20;
    * Baldermann et al. 2019 BPS (first introduced)
    * Irmen et al. 2020 AoN (E-Field generalization first introduced)
    * Li et al. 2020 Nature Communications
* **`DBS stimulation volume`**
  * Synonym / Subdefinition: `Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA)`
  * Subdefinition: `Electric Field (E-Field)`
* **`Subcortical Electrophysiology Mapping`**
  * Brief description: Electrophysiological measures (e.g. beta power) are&#x20;
