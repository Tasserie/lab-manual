# Welcome to the Netstim Laboratory

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world.

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

### Now fun aside.

Welcome, truly. Wether you're a lab member who actually wants to read or write our lab manual, or a colleague interested in what we do, we're happy you are here.
